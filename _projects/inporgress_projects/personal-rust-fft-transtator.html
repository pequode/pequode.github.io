I have a deep admiration for the Fourier Transform(FT) in math. 
This is one neat trick that your doctor doesn't want you to know.
It is represents simple way of breaking down a periodic signal into a single 
spike in a different representation.
 

Intuitively this can be though of like this: 
(this analogy is not complete and hides some of the FT complexity) 
- I can tell you  give you all the points on a sin wave 
- I can tell you that a sin wave has a period of 2pi and has no translations. 

In both examples you can reconstruct the values of the function. 
Excitingly in the second example I give you much less information
and you can still recreate the signal. 

Although initially this is a basic concept it lets us do really cool things! 
One such thing is decompose images into areas of
high frequency and low frequency.

This is important for image processing techniques and 
is actually how JPEG compression works under the hood. 

Very basically when you take a version of the Fourier Transform on 
an image signal called the DFT you start to see cool things. 

In image processing when you pass an image through a DFT you get what is 
called a spectrum.

This spectrum keeps the information in the image that changes slowly 
in one section near the origin. It keeps the information which changes 
faster further away. For an idea of what im talking about,lets consider 
a red ball on a yellow background. Here the ball is all one color and 
the background is also monochromatic. So if you zoomed into any section 
of the image you would get probably get just one color. If you zoomed in 
on the right section however you would get a change of colors between yellow 
black and red. When you take a DFT these areas of change get pulled apart 
from the areas of constancy. You then can mask the low information areas 
of the spectrum to do whats called a high pass filter. 

High pass filtering is the starting point for most classical edge detection 
algorithms.

Edge detection takes an image and then gives us lines where the image changes. 
This is useful in image processing because it allows us to do other tasks 
like segmentation or featurization. 

An edges are basically a silhouette of an image. 

Finally there is another concept called a Fourier Series. This is similar to 
a Taylor Series from calculus. In a Taylor Series we are able to reconstruct 
some function f(x) with its TS approximation g(x). Here g(x) is an polynomial 
of degree n with special co-efficient tuned to the original function. As the 
number of terms in a taylor series grows you get a better and better 
approximation of the original function further and further from the origin.
(Or the region you've tuned your approximation to focus on.)

A Fourier series is a TS but the coefficients used represents different 
frequencies components. As you add terms to a Fourier series you basically 
add the detail to the signal you are approximating. 

I had a project idea to combine these two uses of the Fourier transform to
 make a image -> impressionist image filter. 

I wanted to write it all in rust and js and have it run on the client.

<h1>Crabby Image Converter</h1>
<p>This image converter uses client side OpenCV to first do Canny 
edge detection on an image. Then it will give the points for all edges to a DFT
which runs in rust. This then I can use to calculate my FS coefficients and 
then I can resample in the time domain with a new function approximator.
But I can tune how curvy this is by lopping off terms! </p>
